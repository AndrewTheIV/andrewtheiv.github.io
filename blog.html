    <p><strong>[Andrew@sysfuck ~]$ First and foremost – why did I decide to use Linux?</strong></p>

    <p class="blog-content">
      It’s quite simple. After getting a desktop and running Windows for maybe two weeks, I was already done with it.<br />
      No exaggeration. The whole experience felt like I was a slave to my own machine. No control. Ads. Telemetry. MS Recall.<br />
      Nah just fuck off.
    </p>

    <p class="blog-content">I wanted control.</p>

    <p><strong>[Andrew@sysfuck ~]$ The Hard Switch: Arch + KDE</strong></p>

    <p class="blog-content">
      So I flushed Windows down the toilet and installed Arch. Straight to it.<br />
      KDE Plasma was my first environment. Looked good, worked well.
    </p>

    <p class="blog-content">
      However people say Arch is hard. Not really. If you can read the Arch Wiki and you’re not scared of a terminal,<br />
      you’ll be fine. KDE made it easy too – GUIs for most settings.
    </p>

    <p><strong>[Andrew@sysfuck ~]$ But KDE wasn't it...</strong></p>

    <p class="blog-content">
      KDE was powerful, yeah – but bloated. Too many things I never used.<br />
      Clipboard history, file indexers, fancy effects... stuff I didn’t need or want.
    </p>

    <p class="blog-content">I don’t like bloat. I like minimalism. I like understanding what’s running and why.</p>

    <p><strong>[Andrew@sysfuck ~]$ The Move to DWM</strong></p>

    <p class="blog-content">In May 2025, I switched to DWM. The dynamic window manager from suckless.</p>

    <p class="blog-content">And I love it.</p>

    <p class="blog-content">
      No crap. Just windows and control.<br />
      I wrote my own statusbar scripts, finally achieving the feeling of actually owning my Computer.
    </p>

    <p class="blog-header">Final Thoughts</p>

    <p class="blog-quote">"Linux isn’t just an OS. It’s a mindset."<br />- Sun Zhu</p>
    <p class="blog-quote">"A computer is like an air-conditioning - it becomes useless when you open windows"<br />- Linus Torvalds</p>

    <p class="blog-content">
      On Windows, you're stuck in someone else's idea of a computer.<br />
      On Linux, it's yours.
    </p>

    <p><strong>[Andrew@sysfuck ~]$ TL;DR</strong><br />Never going back.</p>
